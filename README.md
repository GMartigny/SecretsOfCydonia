# SecretsOfCydonia

Welcome to my Javascript game repository. I aim to create a well architectured game from scratch using Javascript's canvas.

I hope learn game developpement more than producing a real game experience. Expect it to be empty.

## Contributing

I'll greatly appreciate any contribution, issue report or advice you can come up with.
